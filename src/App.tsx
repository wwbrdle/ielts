  // Your Country
  {
    id: 1,
    question: "Which part of your country do most people live in?",
    sampleAnswer: "Well, I think most people in my country live in and around Seoul. As you might expect, Seoul is the busiest city in Korea and a lot of people live there. But I think more people live on the outskirts of Seoul and commute in because the rent is cheaper and the air quality is a bit better than in the city.",

  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Tell me about the main industries there.",
    sampleAnswer: "Well, I think the main industries in Seoul are technology and electronics. The city is home to major companies like Samsung, LG, and Hyundai, which create thousands of jobs. Apart from that, hospitality is also a big industry, with coffee shops and bars on almost every corner.",

  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "How easy is it to travel around your country?",
    sampleAnswer: "Actually, I think it's quite easy to travel around Korea. Trains and buses are frequent and affordable, which makes public transport really convenient. There's also a high-speed train that connects major cities, although it's a bit more expensive. On top of that, the roads are excellent, so driving is also a great option if you want more flexibility.",

  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Has your country changed much since you were a child?",
    sampleAnswer: "Yes, I think it has changed massively since I was a child. It has become much more modern and internationally aware. These days, you can easily find food from all over the world and see lots of foreigners living and working in Korea. Technology has also developed rapidly—maybe even too much sometimes!",

  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Do you live in a house or a flat?",
    sampleAnswer: "I live in a basement flat, and it's a cozy space with everything I need. It has a washing machine, a dryer, and good ventilation, which makes it really comfortable to live in.",
    category: "Part 1 - Your Home"
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What are the differences between the place you live now and where you lived before?",
    sampleAnswer: "Well, I think the biggest difference is privacy. Before, I lived in a shared house and rented a single room, which meant I had to share the kitchen and bathroom with others. That wasn't always convenient. Now, I have my own space, which is larger and much more comfortable, and I really enjoy that.",
    category: "Part 1 - Your Home"
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Did you like the place you lived in as a child?",

  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "In the future, what type of home would you like to live in?",
    sampleAnswer: "In the future, I'd love to live in a spacious condo because it's clean and low-maintenance. You don't have to worry about things like gardening, and most condos have great security, which would make me feel safe and comfortable.",

  // Weekends
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "How do you usually spend your weekends?",

  },
  {
    id: 11,
    question: "Which is your favourite part of the weekend?",

  },
  {
    id: 12,
    question: "Do you think your weekends are long enough?",
    sampleAnswer: "Actually, I think weekends are long enough, but they always feel short. Sometimes when I get a long weekend, I feel it can even be a bit too long. Of course, it's nice to have Monday off once in a while, but in general, two days are enough for me to rest and recharge.",
    category: "Part 1 - Weekends"
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    question: "How important do you think it is to have free time at the weekend?",
    sampleAnswer: "That's an interesting question. I think it's absolutely essential because without free time on weekends, people can't really recharge or relax. To stay productive during the week, we need to feel well-rested, so having time to unwind is vital for both our work performance and our overall well-being.",

  // Transportation
  {
    id: 14,
    question: "How often do you use public transport?",
    sampleAnswer: "I usually take the bus every day because I need it to commute to and from work. It normally takes around an hour and a half, so I spend quite a bit of time on public transport.",

  },
  {
    id: 15,
    question: "When was the last time you travelled by public transport?",

  },
  {
    id: 16,
    question: "Do you prefer to use a private car or public transport?",

  },
  {
    id: 17,
    question: "What form of transport would you recommend visitors to your hometown use?",
    sampleAnswer: "I'd definitely recommend visitors to use the Metro because it's fast, punctual, and very convenient for getting around. In Montreal, the Metro connects key areas like downtown and Old Montreal efficiently. It's also a great way to avoid traffic and explore the city comfortably.",
    category: "Part 1 - Transportation"
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    question: "Do you think people will drive more in the future?",
    sampleAnswer: "That's an interesting question. I think people will probably drive more in the future because many households are already buying more than one car for convenience. Unless public transport becomes more attractive, this trend is likely to continue.",
    category: "Part 1 - Transportation"
  },
  {
    id: 19,
    question: "Is driving to work popular in your country?",
    sampleAnswer: "Yes, it's very popular in Korea, mainly because public transport can take longer and follow fixed routes, which isn't always convenient. So a lot of people prefer the flexibility of driving to work.",

  },
  
  // Television
  {
    id: 20,
    question: "How often do you watch television?",

  },
  {
    id: 21,
    question: "Which television channel do you usually watch?",

    category: "Part 1 - Television"
  },
  {
    id: 22,
    question: "Do you enjoy the advertisements on television?",
    sampleAnswer: "Honestly, I definitely don't because advertisements are the most annoying part of watching TV. Just when I'm enjoying a good program, there's a five-minute break with ads. It makes me lose focus, and I often end up switching the channel.",
    category: "Part 1 - Television"
  },
  {
    id: 23,
    question: "Do you think that most programs on television are good?",
    sampleAnswer: "Actually, I don't think so because even though there are so many channels these days, I often struggle to find something interesting. A lot of shows feel repetitive, with similar jokes and ideas, which makes them quite boring for me.",
    category: "Part 1 - Television"
  },
  
  // Newspapers and Magazines
  {
    id: 24,
    question: "Which newspapers and magazines do you read?",

    category: "Part 1 - Newspapers"
  },
  {
    id: 25,
    question: "What kinds of article are you most interested in?",
    sampleAnswer: "I'd say I'm most interested in articles about economics and finance because I'm deeply interested in these areas, especially the stock market. I enjoy keeping up with market trends and investment strategies, and I think it's essential to understand what's happening in your country's economy.",
    category: "Part 1 - Newspapers"
  },
  {
    id: 26,
    question: "Have you ever read a magazine or newspaper in a foreign language?",
    sampleAnswer: "Yes, I have. I remember trying to read a French newspaper when I was in Montreal. The articles were interesting, but my French wasn't strong enough to fully understand everything.

  },
  {
    id: 27,

  },
  {
    id: 30,
    question: "Do you feel that going to a concert is better than listening to a CD, or watching a concert on TV?",
    sampleAnswer: "Yes, I definitely think going to a concert is far better because the energy and interaction you experience there can't be matched by recordings or TV broadcasts. The excitement of the crowd and the live music create an unforgettable atmosphere.",

  },
  {
    id: 31,
    question: "Have you ever been in a choir or some other musical performance?",

  {
    id: 44,

It was big news for Korean people, and I watched news programmes on TV while she was staying in Korea. After that, I went to study in England, and read news, books, and journals about her and royal family so I got to know her more.\n\nWell, to be honest, I'd like to ask her some questions like how she feels, what her hobbies are - just ordinary stuff like I'm talking to my friend. Maybe we could have some tea, and talk to each other if possible.\n\nI admire her because she spent all of her life-time as the queen. I heard that she didn't want to be the queen of England when she was young as the role is a big burden for her. However after all, she did a great job to make England as one of the most powerful countries in the world. Also I think she is not afraid of trying new things out, which I am weak at. An article I read showed a picture of her using iPhone, and she is an early-adapter. It was quite surprising for me as I thought she would only respect tradition.

I've been watching his films since I was a child, and I've always been impressed by his ability to portray such diverse characters convincingly.\n\nI admire him because he seems like a genuinely good person both on and off screen. He's known for his professionalism, kindness, and positive attitude. Despite his fame, he appears to be humble and down-to-earth. I also respect his work ethic and the way he chooses meaningful projects that often have positive messages.",

It actually tasted more like risotto. The rice wasn't that dry, and the seafood like shrimps and mussels were amazing. It was a bit salty but scrumptious. I finished it in about 10 minutes.\n\nI absolutely fell in love with Spanish cuisine including Paella, tapas, and others.

At that time, I was on my own, listening to music while waiting for the bus, and waited for about 20 minutes.\n\nThen when the bus came towards the stop, a young girl suddenly came up somewhere and jumped in the queue right before me. I was so annoyed since I waited for 20 minutes, and there were tons of people behind me. I'm sure most people felt the same thing as me.

A minute after the airplane landed at Heathrow airport in London, I was so excited and everything looked so different. Then I faced really big challenge, I had to talk in English at the immigration inspection.\n\nI was all alone and got to talk to one of the staffs and she seemed not happy as I couldn't really speak English much. She came up with some basic questions like what my purpose of entry is, how long I am going to stay in England, and other questions related to immigration. I was very nervous and couldn't really think of good answers so I mumbled a lot. I don't clearly remember what I really said, but I assume my answers were not quite relevant to the situation. It was like a nightmare. There was huge queue behind me, the immigration officer was staring at me, and I was scared by the situation so couldn't even speak a single thing. So she made me to stay at the airport for like 5 hours until a translator came.\n\nIt was quite embarrassing experience. I felt really embarrassing while sitting in the immigration office. I thought it happened because I wasn't good at English so kind of decided to study hard. Also I felt quite scary. I thought that I would be sent to Korea straight after I reached England, and actually saw a few people going back to their country because they couldn't obtain visa on that day. So I felt really nervous until I came out of the airport, I didn't want to go back on the first day I arrived in England. After that, I never had the same experience, and don't want to experience similar situation whenever I travel.",

        sampleAnswer: "I use eye sleeping shades when it's noisy or bright. I turn everything off around me to sleep well. I aim for a good sleep every night, typically for around 3 to 4 hours, as I sleep relatively shorter hours. It's rare for me not to sleep well, but when struggling, I drink warm tea or milk to relax."

        question: "Can you sleep well if there is noise around?",
        sampleAnswer: "No, not at all. I am very sensitive at noise and can't sleep at all if there's any noise around. When I'm really tired or need good sleep, I sometimes use earplugs to sleep deeply."
